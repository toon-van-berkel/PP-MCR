# MCR (My Chemical Romance) Fan-Made Website
This project started out as a simple design practice, but it quickly grew into a full HTML and CSS practice website. Inspired by the band My Chemical Romance, I created a fan-made site that captures their dark, alternative aesthetic while experimenting with layout, typography, and styling.  

The goal of this project was to challenge myself with building a visually striking website that didn’t just look like a generic template. By using bold colors, layered sections, and expressive visuals, I tried to reflect the atmosphere and style of the band.  

This assignment became more than just design — it was an opportunity to practice semantic HTML, responsive CSS layouts, and hover effects, while also learning how to combine creativity with clean front-end code.
